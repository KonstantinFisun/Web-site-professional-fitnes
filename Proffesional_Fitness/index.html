                    During your first visit to the gym, an instructor will help you find your way. One or more instructors are present to help you with your training, answer your questions and to secure a comfortable and safe environment. Ask the instructors to help you at any time, as they can show you how to train both safe and effective, inspire you with new exercises and keep you motivated. For a personal training plan (free of additional costs) you can book an appointment with an instructor at the Gym desk.
